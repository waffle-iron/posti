#Welcome to Posti

You might have arrived here from my previous [project](https://github.com/naphipps/SeatingSystem) so you may already be familiar about this topic. Here, you will find the code I'm currently working in order to create a seating chart system. The core motivation behind this is to help FUGE camp Program Directors in their adventures.
